Essay on the Agile Philosophy

The question I intend to answer in my essay is "What are the key benefits and drawbacks of daily scrum meetings and how could they be leveraged or overcome in a game development project?". To answer this question I will look at how daily scrum meetings are currently used in agile development and some of the protentional weaknesses of the current method. I will also research into better practices of the daily scrum which could make the system more effective.

# Research Notes 
## Do Daily Scrums Have to Take Place Each Day? A Case Study of Customized Scrum Principles at an E-commerce Company 
This paper is a case study of an e-commerce company that adopts the agile and scrum methodology. It first describes the all the principles of scrum in a product management context. This includes some special extensions to the scrum principles such as the product roadmap, "a planning artifact that illustrates how the product will evolve within the subsequent versions". The paper then outlines research approach and the results of the case study. The case study consisted of four product teams with seven to nine members. Interestingly only one of the four teams used daily scrum meetings, the other three had regular meetings only two or three times a week. The reason they did not have meetings every day was because some of the team members were assigned to more than one team at the same time. So in cases where employees are assigned to several teams at the same time, daily meetings in each of the teams would lead to severe constraints on behalf of those employees. Although all the teams didn’t use the daily scrum as intended, the general concept of the meeting is applied across all teams, and the interviewees confirm the benefits of such meetings.
